# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

A function is a digital engine that takes in fuel (data / decision structures) and outputs power (new knowledge / manipulated information). Different fuel leads to different performance results. We use functions to refine raw data into a usable product. Functions should have generic variables so we can change the input at anytime.


#### 2. What is a method?

A method is a built-in preset tool, like '.length', that provides and quick accessibility of data and editing of variables.


#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?

.charAt() returns the character at the specified index

.concat() joins two or more strings, and returns a new joined strings


#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?

Accessors locate and retrieve specific info from a data set, use this to gather and organize temporary results without changing the source. Mutators edit data and provide new results, permanently changing the information.


#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

Console.log prints whatever you run through it's parentheses, so that the dev can test and view a function outcome. Return tells the function what to do after it gathers and runs the variables through executable code.


#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  

Connecting the dots between macro examples and detailed data work, so the brain can comprehend the goal and better visualize the purpose and steps.
